WiiRemoteFramework is version 0.5 with some fixed discovery bugs and added
comments. Original is downloaded from here:

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/darwiin-remote/files/WiiRemoteFramework/

I wasted quite a lot of time on getting the 0.5 version to work before
realising that 0.5 is a very old version and new versions are available
only from the DarwiinRemote svn repository:

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/darwiin-remote/develop
    svn co https://darwiin-remote.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/darwiin-remote/WiiRemoteFramework darwiin-remote

and the >0.6 compiled version is distributed inside DarwiinRemote:

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/darwiin-remote/files/ 
    DarwiinRemote-2011-03-08-10-00.dmg

But the new version didn't work at all, so.. long live the old new version!

That's what you get for using sourceforge.
